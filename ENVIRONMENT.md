# Environment Variables

This document lists all environment variables used in the Kilo Code cloud monorepo.

## Core / System

- `NODE_ENV` - Node environment (`development`, `production`, `test`); used by virtually every package. [SERVER]
- `CI` - Set to `true` in CI environments; detected by Next.js, Playwright, Vitest, and various tooling to alter behavior (non-interactive, skip prompts, etc.). [SERVER]
- `PORT` - Port for local dev servers. Next.js defaults to 3000; used by `apps/web/src/lib/constants.ts` and various test servers. [SERVER]
- `HOME` - User home directory; used by child processes spawned by services (OpenClaw resolves `~/.openclaw`, Expo devcert for mkcert certs). [SYSTEM]
- `PATH` - System executable search path; modified by tooling (OpenClaw, tsx, etc.) to locate CLIs. [SYSTEM]
- `TMUX` - Set when running inside a tmux session; used by `dev/local/tmux.ts` to detect tmux environment. [SYSTEM]
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS` - Set to `true` by GitHub Actions CI; detected by tooling (Rye log groups, Playwright, Vitest) to enable GitHub Actions-specific output/reporting. [SERVER]
- `NEXT_RUNTIME` - Set by Next.js to `'node'`, `'edge'`, or `'browser'`; used in `apps/web/src/instrumentation.ts` to select appropriate Sentry instrumentation. [SERVER]
- `DOTENV_CONFIG_QUIET` - Set by dotenv to suppress load output; set to `'true'` in `dev/seed/lib/preflight.ts:9` during seeding. [SERVER]

## App (apps/web)

Manage shared web env var additions and rotations with `pnpm web:env set <VARIABLE>`. The helper coordinates tracked root and `apps/web` dotenv defaults, the `kilocode-app` and `kilocode-global-app` Vercel deployments, and 1Password storage for sensitive Production values. See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for the full workflow.

### Configuration & Constant URLs

- `TRPC_TIMING_LOGGING` - Enables tRPC timing logs in development; checked in `apps/web/src/lib/trpc/init.ts`. [SERVER]
- `TRPC_TIMING_SAMPLE_RATE` - Sample rate (`0`-`1`) for non-mobile request timing lines; mobile clients are always logged. Defaults to `0.01` when unset or malformed; read in `apps/web/src/lib/observability/request-timing.ts`. [SERVER]
- `JEST_MAX_WORKERS` - Limits max worker threads for Jest; read in `apps/web/jest.config.ts`. [SERVER]
- `JEST_SILENT` - When `false`, shows verbose Jest output; read in `apps/web/jest.config.ts` and `apps/web/.env.test`. [SERVER]
- `JEST_WORKER_ID` - Set by Jest to identify the current worker thread; used by db connection pooling and libraries to handle worker-specific state. [SERVER]
- `IS_SCRIPT` - Set to `'true'` by `apps/web/src/scripts/index.ts` to indicate a script-mode run (bypasses web server logic). Used by Drizzle in `packages/db/src/database-url.ts`. [SERVER]
- `SECURITY_AGENT_AUDIT_RELIABLE_COVERAGE_START` - Earliest ISO timestamp from which Security Agent Audit Report event coverage is reliable. [SERVER]

### Analytics & Monitoring

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_DEBUG` - Enables PostHog debug logging; checked in `apps/web/src/components/PostHogProvider.tsx` and `apps/web/src/lib/stytch.ts`. [PUBLIC]
- `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` - PostHog personal API key used by user-deletion PostHog cleanup. `[SECRET]`
- `POSTHOG_ENVIRONMENT_ID` - PostHog project/environment ID used by user-deletion PostHog cleanup. [SERVER]
- `POSTHOG_HOST` - Optional PostHog API host override for user-deletion cleanup; defaults to `https://us.posthog.com`. [SERVER]

- `CUSTOMERIO_TRACK_BASE` - Optional Customer.io Track API base override for local user-deletion cleanup; defaults to `https://track.customer.io`. [SERVER]
- `SUBSTACK_PUBLICATION_URL` - Substack publication origin used by user-deletion subscriber cleanup; defaults to `https://blog.kilo.ai`. Must be `blog.kilo.ai` or a `*.substack.com` host. The Substack admin search URL is hardcoded to `https://kilocode.substack.com/publish/subscribers`, not this publication. [SERVER]
- `CSA_APP_BASE_URL` - CSA origin used by the Cloud deletion worker to call `POST /api/internal/cloud/users/gdpr-scrub`. Example: the production CSA app URL. [SERVER]
- `CSA_VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS` - CSA Vercel Deployment Protection automation bypass. Cloud sends it as the `x-vercel-protection-bypass` header on Cloud → CSA `POST /api/internal/cloud/users/gdpr-scrub`, never as a query parameter. Required when CSA has Vercel Authentication enabled; without it Vercel returns 401 before the CSA route. Distinct from `SUPPORT_API_SECRET`. `[SECRET]`
- `SENTRY_ORG` - Sentry organization slug for source map uploads; used in `apps/web/next.config.mjs`. `[SECRET]`

### Vercel & Build Info

- `VERCEL_ENV` - Vercel environment (`development`, `preview`, `production`); used in `apps/web/next.config.mjs`, `apps/web/src/lib/constants.ts`, and `apps/web/.env.test`. [SERVER]

### Security & Auth

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` - Cloudflare Turnstile public site key; used in `apps/web/src/components/auth/sign-in/TurnstileView.tsx`. [PUBLIC]
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` - Cloudflare Turnstile secret key; used in test files. `[SECRET]`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_PROJECT_ENV` - Stytch public project environment identifier; used in `apps/web/src/components/auth/StytchClient.tsx`. [PUBLIC]
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN` - Stytch public token for client SDKs; used in `apps/web/src/components/auth/StytchClient.tsx`. [PUBLIC]
- `STYTCH_PROJECT_ID` - Stytch project ID for secret-side SDK calls. `[SECRET]`
- `STYTCH_PROJECT_SECRET` - Stytch project secret. `[SECRET]`
- `STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN` - Stytch legacy public token alias used in some test fixtures. [PUBLIC]
- `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` - Shared secret for internal API calls between services; used in `apps/web/src/lib/kiloclaw/cli-runs.test.ts`, `kiloclaw-router.test.ts`, dev seed scripts, and other service routers. `[SECRET]`
- `SUPPORT_API_SECRET` - Shared bearer token for Customer Support Automation (CSA) internal API calls. Cloud uses it to authorize CSA → Cloud `apps/web/src/app/api/internal/support/` and Cloud → CSA `POST /api/internal/cloud/users/gdpr-scrub`. A CSA compromise can also call Cloud deletion and Cloud can scrub CSA-local PII. Leak can look up any email and enqueue deletion for non-admin, non-bot, non-live-subscription customers; access disable is deferred to worker preflight and pending requests can be cancelled. Keep production values off preview deployments; rotate Cloud and CSA together. `[SECRET]`
- `BOUNDED_INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Set to exact `true` to enable modern, purpose-labelled internal assertions at the Phase 5.1 bounded Git broker, export, deletion, and Session Ingest callsites. Unset or any other value retains their existing legacy token formats. Enable only after compatible readers, including the dedicated GitHub disconnect audience, are deployed; generic human/control/runtime signers are not affected. [SERVER]
- `NATIVE_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Set to exact `true` to permit fresh native adoption of separate one-hour API/gateway access tokens only for clients explicitly requesting `api-gateway-v1`, provided `SHARED_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` is also exact `true`. Default-off. Unsupported clients keep legacy responses. Turning this flag off affects subsequent native issuance/refreshes only; active modern device credentials can continue receiving bounded control tokens while their owned device session and current user pepper remain valid. [SERVER]
- `SHARED_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Master default-off readiness gate. Fresh modern producer issuance requires both this flag and its family flag below to be exact `true`; unset or any other value disables adoption. Native adoption separately requires `NATIVE_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` and this master, independent of producer families; old CLI negotiation is unchanged. These flags do not revoke existing credentials. Valid modern device access credentials retain bounded control issuance after rollback, with current owned-session, pepper, and requested organization membership validation and a one-hour/parent-expiry cap. Chat likewise retains bounded three-audience issuance for validated modern devices; modern credentials never fall back to broad legacy tokens. Persisted modern workload renewal does not use adoption gates. Separately deployed readers/producers must be verified before activation. [SERVER]
- `CLOUD_AGENT_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Default-off family gate for Cloud Agent Next request control and workflow control tokens; requires the master and exact `true`. [SERVER]
- `GASTOWN_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Default-off family gate for Gastown control tokens; requires the master and exact `true`. This is not a safe-activation declaration: known ingest-audience and live-token-transport blockers remain deferred. [SERVER]
- `WASTELAND_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Default-off family gate for Wasteland control tokens; requires the master and exact `true`. [SERVER]
- `CHAT_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Default-off family gate for fresh chat resource issuance; requires the master and exact `true`. Validated modern devices retain chat/event-service/notifications issuance after rollback, capped by one hour and parent expiry. [SERVER]
- `DELEGATED_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Default-off family gate for explicit API, gateway, attribution, and HTML-deploy delegation, including the organization user-token resource route; requires the master and exact `true`. Disabled explicit delegation remains unavailable. [SERVER]
- `WORKFLOW_GATEWAY_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Default-off family gate for server workflow gateway tokens; requires the master and exact `true`. [SERVER]
- `BENCHMARK_RESOURCE_TOKENS_ENABLED` - Default-off family gate for benchmark resource tokens; requires the master and exact `true`. [SERVER]
- `RUNTIME_ISOLATION_ENABLED` - Cloud Agent Worker rollout control for new modern control-plane sessions and worktree destinations. Production and dev Worker configs set this to `true`; exact `true` permits adoption, while unset/other values reject it before durable work. Legacy attachments keep directory-shared Kilo runtimes. Persisted modern runtime authorization continues selecting per-session isolation after rollback, and the connected wrapper must advertise the isolation capability. Actual web issuance remains off behind its separate issuance gates. Outstanding smoke failures must be resolved before merge; enabling this Worker admission gate does not remove that merge prerequisite. Foreground expiry recovery retains the same session identity and requires acknowledged idle transport retirement; this flag does not establish complete real-provider smoke coverage. See `docs/token-issuance-policy.md`, Phase 5.2 merge, automatic deployment, and activation. [SERVER]
- `CALLBACK_TOKEN_SECRET` - Secret for signing callback tokens. Required for local development. `[SECRET]`
- `INTERNAL_SECRET` - Alias/fallback for `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`; used in KiloClaw E2E scripts (`services/kiloclaw/e2e/`). `[SECRET]`

  - During the migration-to-app promotion window, old pending-install callbacks may fail against the replaced pending indexes. Keep the window brief, monitor deploy health, and retry the GitHub connection after promotion completes.
- `PER_REPO_SETTINGS` - Set to exactly `true` to reveal the Repository Customizations UI (per-installation default AI model / PR review mode, plus per-repository overrides) on the GitHub integration settings pages, for both personal accounts and organizations. Defaults to disabled so the feature can ship dark. [SERVER]

### Email & Notifications

- `MAILGUN_API_KEY` - Mailgun API key for transactional email. Used only when `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` is `production` or `staging`. `[SECRET]`
- `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` - Mailgun sending domain. Used only when `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` is `production` or `staging`. [SERVER]
- `NEVERBOUNCE_API_KEY` - NeverBounce API key for email verification. In staging, only the effective internal sink is verified. `[SECRET]`
- `STAGING_EMAIL_REDIRECT_TO` - Required when `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV=staging`. Must contain exactly one valid address in the `kilocode.ai` domain; every staging message is redirected there with a staging subject prefix and safe Reply-To. [SERVER]
- `LOCAL_EMAIL_OPEN_BROWSER` - Set to `false` to stop locally captured emails from opening in a browser tab. Defaults to opening each capture. Local development only. [SERVER]

When `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` is absent in local development or a script process, transactional messages are captured as owner-only clickable HTML under `dev/logs/emails/` instead of being sent. Automated tests (including `IS_IN_AUTOMATED_TEST`) and non-production Vercel targets suppress provider delivery and report successful no-op delivery. A production-mode process without `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` fails delivery as a configuration error so retryable email markers are not consumed as successful sends.

## Services

### Notifications Worker

- `APNS_TEAM_ID` - Apple Developer team ID for the token-based APNs key used to send Live Activity pushes. Set in `services/notifications/wrangler.jsonc` under `vars`. [SERVER]
- `APNS_KEY_ID` - APNs key identifier (`kid`) for the Live Activity push key. Set beside `APNS_TEAM_ID`. [SERVER]
- `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY` - PKCS#8 ES256 `.p8` private key contents for APNs provider-token signing. Stored as one line: the PEM decoder strips every whitespace character, so the newlines are not needed. Store the key in the Secrets Store first, then add its `secrets_store_secrets` binding; a binding for a missing secret fails the deploy. `[SECRET]`
- `APNS_TOPIC` - iOS app bundle id (`com.kilocode.kiloapp`); Live Activity pushes use `<topic>.push-type.liveactivity`. Already set in `vars`. [SERVER]
- `KILO_WEB_API_BASE_URL` - Base origin of the web app, used to reach the internal `glanceable-agents-snapshot` route; `https://app.kilo.ai` in production. [SERVER]

Until all four values reach the worker it logs `APNs Live Activity credentials missing` and skips Live Activity pushes. Every other glanceable delivery, including the Expo aggregate push, keeps working.

The key is team-scoped for all topics and valid in both the sandbox and production APNs environments. A backup of the `.p8` lives in the 1Password "Eng / Product" vault as "Apple AuthKey KRYMZL626P (.p8)"; Apple never serves it a second time.
