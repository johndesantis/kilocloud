/**
 * Runtime-health reducer (design §6). Pure: no I/O, no clock read, no storage.
 * `decideHealth(state, event, now)` returns `undefined` when the event is not
 * accepted for the state (an explicit rejection, not a silent no-op).
 *
 * Recovery is owned here: entering or advancing it emits a `Reconcile` command,
 * and the single attempt budget (`recoveryMaxAttempts`) is enforced against the
 * attempts actually recorded, never against a supplied verdict.
