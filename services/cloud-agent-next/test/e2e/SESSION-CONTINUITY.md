# Session continuity E2E catalog

Requirement source: `.specs/cloud-agent-session.md` -- `Persistence` and
`Continuity`. This file maps that contract to concrete, reusable lifecycle
scenarios. It is the working plan for the harness; update the status column as
scenarios land.

## The contract in one line

A chat must work like a colleague across a long relationship: many turns, walk
away, come back, interrupt, ask questions, open more chats -- and **any
transient failure must be recoverable by sending another message in the same
chat**. Creating a new chat to continue the same work is a defect, except for a
narrow, documented set of unrecoverable causes.

## What "pass" means

- **Recovery**: after an induced transient failure, the next message on the
  SAME `workspace_*` session completes. No new session, no manual workaround.
- **No permanent wedge**: a chat reaches a terminal, recoverable state; the only
  hard-failed messages are genuinely unrecoverable causes.
- **Continuity**: history/transcript is restored after a cold environment;
  uncommitted files are explicitly not guaranteed (see Data loss below).
- **Isolation**: siblings in one worktree share files but not chat state or
  questions.
- **Repeatability**: each scenario is green across N repeats with no unexplained
  flake.

Status legend: `PASS` verified live | `PARTIAL` exists but does not assert the
full contract | `PLANNED` not written | `BLOCKED` needs an enabler.

## Scenario catalog

### A. Single-session continuity (the core promise)

| ID | Scenario (name) | Asserts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `long-session-20` | 20+ turns, real writes/reads/edits, one sandbox the whole time | PARTIAL -- `long-session` does 11 turns and asserts checkpoint identity; extend the count |
| A2 | `cold-resume-history` | auto idle-stop -> resume on a new container -> message history restored -> next turn completes | PARTIAL -- `cold-resume` asserts history first and a stable Git HEAD; dirty-file survival is observed only (not guaranteed across environment replacement) |
| A3 | `warm-cold-cycles` | work -> idle -> resume -> work -> idle -> resume in one session | PARTIAL -- `warm-cold-cycles` runs two full cycles with independent idle-stop evidence, old-primary absence, distinct replacement container, history, and a completed ordered-lifecycle follow-up; each cycle records its resumed message id and dirty-file survival (non-gating), and completed cycles are retained even if a later cycle fails |
| A4 | `interrupt-then-continue` | interrupt mid-turn; the next message continues the same chat, in the SAME container while the idle timer has not fired | PASS -- `interrupt-then-continue` asserts `cloud.message.failed reason=interrupted`, a completed follow-up, and an unchanged container id |
| A5 | `recover-same-session` | induce a transient failure (heartbeat lapse / wrapper crash / allocation loss); the next message on the SAME session completes | PARTIAL -- `recover-same-session` captures the target connection by `sandboxId` + connection/wrapper identity, requires a matched recovery-start `allocation_transition` (`allocated.healthy -> allocated.recovering` with `event=deadline`) before any recovery send, and completes a new ordered-lifecycle message on the original session. Proven: heartbeat-expiry attribution for the captured connection. Not proven: disconnect-classified runs (`event=health_observed`) are generic same-session recovery, not heartbeat coverage; and the wrapper pre-pause last-send line is captured but not used for classification |
| A6 | `short-sessions` | one-turn chats opened, completed, and repeated | PARTIAL -- `cold`/`hot` approximate it; no repeat/open-close loop |

### B. Multi-chat / worktree

| ID | Scenario (name) | Asserts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `new-chat-after-completed` | a chat completes a turn, then a sibling chat is created and works | PASS -- `multi-session-collab`, fixed this cycle |
| B2 | `three-chat-chain` | planner -> implementer -> reviewer artifacts across three chats | PASS -- `multi-session-collab` |
| B3 | `many-siblings` | 3-5 chats interleaved; simultaneous gates; targeted cancel | PARTIAL -- `worktree-shared` covers 2 siblings + simultaneous gates + targeted cancel |
| B4 | `parallel-sessions` | two independent sessions running turns at the same time | PASS -- `concurrent-chats` runs three independent sessions behind simultaneous gates, proves overlapping `running`, and splits clean-load vs recovered-under-load |

### C. Interactive tools

| ID | Scenario (name) | Asserts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `question-isolation` | a question is answerable in its own chat only; sibling isolation; replay after refresh | PASS -- `worktree-shared` (`question=isolated; questionRefresh=replayed`) |
| C2 | `unanswered-question-idle` | an unanswered question does not pin the environment; idle winds it down; restore then answer/continue | PARTIAL -- `question-idle-resume` requires a positive `inspectControlPlaneQuestions` observation scoped to the captured question while the primary is inspectable (inspection failure is INCONCLUSIVE), the parked turn to settle terminal (`failed`/`interrupted`) before continuing (the exact-match target heartbeat payload `reportedState`/allocation-wide `pendingMessages` plus payload-derived `sessionState`/`sessionWaitingOn` is the input-wait proof and may be absent once terminal), idle-stop within budget, and continued work on a replacement container. Sibling isolation is not claimed |
| C3 | `targeted-cancel` | cancelling a sibling does not disturb the other root | PASS -- `worktree-shared` `targetedCancellation` |

### D. Liveness under load

| ID | Scenario (name) | Asserts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | `rapid-varied-turns` | back-to-back turns at varied token rates, plus large streamed tool output (bash/file reads) | PARTIAL -- `large-stream` requests a 256 KiB real read-tool output plus a paced follow-up; coverage is claimed only for the exact `call_<tag>_read` completed read whose streamed part is correlated AND whose persisted output meets the request, otherwise `requestedBytes`/`observedBytes`/`writtenFileBytes` are recorded and coverage is not claimed |
| D2 | `concurrent-sessions` | several sessions each doing turns at once; no heartbeat expiry, no failed messages | PARTIAL -- `concurrent-chats` classifies each of three sessions `completed_clean`/`completed_after_recovery`/`wedged`/`failed` from matched recovery-start `allocation_transition` evidence, sends a same-chat follow-up where the turn did not complete, and reports the clean-vs-recovered split. Proven: no session wedges or fails without a completed same-chat follow-up. Not proven: the exact load level that triggers recovery, or a clean run with zero expiries every time |
| D3 | `long-slow-turn` | one long streamed turn; heartbeat keeps flowing; turn completes | PARTIAL -- `interrupt-mid-stream`/`hang` cover abort, not sustained length |
| D4 | `stall-injection` | deterministically stall the wrapper; the worker recovers the SAME session | PARTIAL -- `recover-same-session` freezes the owned primary with `docker pause` and requires the identity-matched heartbeat-expiry recovery chain; a generic `health_observed` recovery start proves same-session recovery, not heartbeat-lapse coverage |
| D5 | `feed-stale-recovery` | freeze only the Kilo server of a SHARED worktree runtime so its inbound `/global/event` feed goes silent; the wrapper/container stay alive and the feed recovers without retiring the runtime | PASS (observed) -- `feed-stale-recovery` opens two chats in one worktree, asserts the sibling attached with `reuse reason=live_entry` to the shared Kilo process, `kill -STOP`s only that PID (never the container), observes `phase=stale`/`phase=recovering reason=feed_stale`, verifies the outbound wrapper heartbeat still advances while the feed is silent, releases before the 120s episode deadline, then requires no `Kilo worktree retired reason=feed_stale`, a `phase=recovered` feed line carrying the ORIGINAL native runtime id, chat A's follow-up on that surviving runtime, and chat B's follow-up plus convergence of both roots on one worktree runtime in the original container. In local dev (credential containment off) the sibling re-attach refreshes its session credentials and rotates the shared entry's native runtime; the scenario treats that refresh as an orthogonal product action, not a feed-stale retirement. On pre-change code the retirement is logged ~30-40s in and the scenario fails fast on the `Kilo worktree retired` line |
| D6 | `wrapper-freeze-settled-reap` | freeze ONLY the control-wrapper Bun process (`bun run ...kilocode-control-wrapper.js`) after a completed turn; recovery exhausts without a re-ready runtime and reaps the allocation with the settled-reap cause, then a distinct replacement serves the same session | PARTIAL -- `wrapper-freeze-settled-reap` boots, completes a real gated turn, captures the target connection by `sandboxId` + connection/wrapper identity, captures the control-wrapper Bun PID in one `docker exec` scanning `/proc/*/cmdline` (exactly one argv carrying both `bun` and `kilocode-control-wrapper.js`; zero/ambiguous throws; never the Kilo PID), `SIGSTOP`s only that PID, and proves the container is still listed. It then requires the identity-matched recovery-start `allocation_transition` (`allocated.healthy -> allocated.recovering` with `event=deadline`), asserts no identity-matched `wrapper_ready` after the freeze (the freeze plus a silent readiness log is the "no ready runtime at the stop decision" proof), requires the `allocation_transition` `allocated.* -> stopping.destroying` with `reason` equal to `RECOVERY_SETTLED_REAP_REASON`, the old primary absent, and a completed follow-up on a DISTINCT replacement container. The freeze is held until that stop commit, which proves the cleanup deadline elapsed. Not proven: the production provider's `forceDestroy` latency and the platform idle timer, native-retirement escalation, and sibling-work protection (unit-tested only) |
| D7 | `wrapper-freeze-inflight-reap` | the incident shape: freeze the control-wrapper Bun process while a gated turn is still held; the original message terminalises `runtime_unhealthy`, the route stays stale-active, recovery exhausts and reaps with the settled cause, and the SAME `workspace_*` session continues on a replacement | PARTIAL -- `wrapper-freeze-inflight-reap` sends a real gated turn, confirms an identity-matched active route report from the captured connection, freezes ONLY the control-wrapper PID while the gate is held, and requires: an exact `cloud.message.failed status=failed` terminal for the message id; an `accepted_reconciliation result=runtime_unhealthy` record whose `messageId` exactly matches the sent message and whose retained `sessionId`/`expectedWrapperInstanceId` match the captured session and wrapper (a record without `messageId` does not match, so a wrong-cause failure in another session cannot satisfy the scenario); the last identity-matched heartbeat reports `active` and no post-freeze heartbeat changes it (stale-active); the same `allocation_transition` recovery-start and settled stop as D6; the old primary absent; and a completed follow-up on the SAME `workspace_*` session with a DISTINCT replacement. Not proven: production timings/provider, and sibling-work protection |

`wrapper-freeze-settled-reap`/`wrapper-freeze-inflight-reap` must NOT report a
stop when the frozen wrapper sends a `wrapper_ready` frame after the freeze: the
readiness veto defers the settled reap with a retained five-minute retry, so a
re-readied run is *deferred*, not terminalised, and must not be asserted to stop.
Both scenarios therefore assert no identity-matched `wrapper_ready` after the
freeze before accepting the settled-reap cause.

### E. Delivery correctness

| ID | Scenario (name) | Asserts | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | `exactly-once-retry` | an ambiguous send that is retried produces exactly one turn | PLANNED |
| E2 | `send-while-in-flight` | a follow-up while a turn is running is queued and delivered in order | PASS -- `queue-while-busy` (FIFO through `cloud.message.*`) |
| E3 | `send-during-recovery` | a send during recovery is queued and delivered, not terminalized | PLANNED |

## Data loss is out of scope (for now)

Uncommitted file changes are not guaranteed across environment replacement
(spec Persistence rule 4). `cold-resume` asserts message history and a stable
Git HEAD first, and records dirty-file survival as a non-gating observation
(`fileSurvived=true|false (observed, exact-equality)`, or
`fileSurvived=error:<reason>` when the inspection itself fails). It no longer
fails the scenario when the sentinel is missing.

## Enablers to build

1. **Fake directives**
   - `big-stream:<bytes>[:chunkBytes]` -- large content stream to stress framing.
   - `tool-stream:<tag>:<bytes>` -- landed; writes `bytes` with the real write
     tool, reads it back with the real read tool, then completes. `large-stream`
     uses it.
   - `rate:<chunks>:<ms>` and rate variation around `realistic` for token/sec.
   - `question:<tag>:<text>` -- landed; raises a real Kilo question that stays
     open until answered. The parked turn settles either by the fenced
     five-minute inactivity abort or by idle shutdown, so C2 proves the
     question does not pin the environment.
2. **Fault injection (test-only seams)**
   - `pauseOwnedPrimary`/`unpauseOwnedPrimary` (chunk 2) freeze and unfreeze the
     exact owned primary; `recover-same-session` uses this to lapse heartbeats.
    - `signalKiloServerProcess` freezes/unfreezes the exact in-container Kilo
      server PID with `docker exec kill -STOP`/`kill -CONT` while the container
      and wrapper stay alive; `feed-stale-recovery` uses this to silence only the
      inbound `/global/event` feed.
    - `captureControlWrapperProcess` captures the exact control-wrapper Bun
      process (`bun run ...kilocode-control-wrapper.js`) in one `docker exec`
      scanning `/proc/*/cmdline`; the `wrapper-freeze-*` scenarios pair it with
      `signalKiloServerProcess` to `SIGSTOP`/`SIGCONT` only that PID. This is a
      process freeze, not a wrapper exit/reconnect, so it does NOT satisfy the
      A5 wrapper-exit/reconnect enabler below.
    - Force a wrapper process exit / reconnect (A5) -- still uses existing kill paths.
   - Reuse existing `external-kill` / `kill-mid-flight` loss paths, but fix their
     cleanup ownership probe first (it currently throws on restore paths).
3. **Observability (needed to root-cause, not just detect)**
   - Heartbeat: last *sent* (wrapper) vs *received* and *accepted/rearmed*
     (worker), per connection, plus what armed the expiry (`readyAt` vs
     heartbeat). A lapse must be attributable, not guessed.
   - Dispatch: phase, failure category, attempt count, retry decision, and the
     outcome that made the same-session retry succeed.
   - Recovery: which fault triggered it. The worker emits one
     `allocation_transition` line per committed transition (`aggregate=allocation`,
     `from`/`to` state keys, `event`, `deadline`, plus the connection/wrapper
     identities). `recover-same-session` requires a matched recovery start
     (`allocated.healthy -> allocated.recovering`): `event=deadline` is a
     heartbeat expiry, `event=health_observed` is a disconnect, and a start from
     any other state or event is INCONCLUSIVE. Timestamp-only correlation is not
     accepted.
   - Heartbeat per-session evidence: the worker heartbeat diagnostic emits a
     bounded `.`-joined `sessionReport` plus, when the DO has exactly one route,
     exact `kiloSessionId`/`sessionState`/`sessionWaitingOn` fields.
     `question-idle-resume` reads only an exact target `kiloSessionId` match on
     the captured connection; missing target evidence is INCONCLUSIVE.

## Running

```bash
export E2E_USER_EMAIL=evgeny@kilocode.ai
export WORKER_URL=http://localhost:8894
export FAKE_LLM_URL=http://localhost:8911
export KILO_SESSION_INGEST_URL=http://localhost:8900
pnpm -C services/cloud-agent-next exec tsx test/e2e/run.ts <scenario> _
```

Wrapper source changes need a sandbox image rebuild before they take effect
(restart `cloud-agent-next`; confirm a new `cloudflare-dev/sandbox:*` image).

Run each scenario N times for flake detection. Record the environment (load,
concurrent chats) on the run, and never treat "a fresh run passed" as recovery.

## Existing scenario inventory (for reuse)

`run.ts` lifecycle names today: `cold`, `hot`, `followup`, `cold-hot`,
`worktree-shared`, `long-session`, `cold-resume`, `multi-session-collab`,
`external-kill`, `kill-mid-flight`, `queue-while-busy`,
`queue-rapid-fire-no-gate`, `queue-overflow`, `queue-interrupt-clears`,
`llm-error`, `chunked-streaming`, `empty-response`, `interrupt-mid-stream`,
`unknown-model`, `waiters-clean`, `callback-completion`,
`callback-batch-followup`, `callback-interrupt`, `gate-0`, plus the continuity
scenarios: `recover-same-session`, `interrupt-then-continue`,
`warm-cold-cycles`, `question-idle-resume`, `large-stream`, `concurrent-chats`,
`feed-stale-recovery`, `wrapper-freeze-settled-reap`,
`wrapper-freeze-inflight-reap`.

Continuity scenario default timeouts (`CONTINUITY_SCENARIO_TIMEOUT_MS` in
`lifecycle-continuity.ts`): 8, 6, 25, 20, 10, 15, 10, 12, and 12 minutes in the
order above. All nine require the unified API, `kilo/fake-deterministic`, and
control-plane + worktree enrollment, like the file-state scenarios.

Status gaps: the nine continuity scenarios exercise the same-session recovery
core (A3/A4/A5/C2/D1/D2/D4/D6/D7) plus the silent-feed recovery path (D5), but
A5/D4 remain PARTIAL: a run attributed to `heartbeat_expiry` proves heartbeat-lapse
recovery for the captured connection, while a `health_observed` recovery start
proves only generic same-session recovery. D6/D7 are new and are not a live pass claim
until run and observed green; that result is recorded per run, not asserted here.
Remaining gaps are E1/E3 and repeat/flake counts.
