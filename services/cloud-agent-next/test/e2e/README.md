# cloud-agent-next local E2E harness

Drives the real `pnpm dev:start cloud-agent` stack end-to-end — Worker,
Durable Object, Sandbox container, wrapper, and **real kilo** inside the
sandbox. Only LLM inference is deterministic: selecting
`kilo/fake-deterministic` makes the local Next.js gateway proxy kilo's
OpenRouter-shaped calls to `test/e2e/fake-llm-server.ts`.

Not wired into `pnpm test` / CI — this is for local confidence during the
cloud-agent-next refactor.

## One-time setup

1. Copy `.dev.vars.example` → `.dev.vars` and fill in local values.
   Leave `KILO_OPENROUTER_BASE` pointed at local Next.js (`@url nextjs/api`).
   For control-plane scenarios, enroll the E2E user in `CONTROL_PLANE_IDS`.
   `worktree-shared` additionally requires `WORKTREE_CREATION_ENABLED_IDS`; it creates a fresh
   personal user per run, so set both flags to `*` for that local scenario.
   Both accept comma-separated user or org IDs or `*`. Production defaults to empty/off;
   wrangler `dev` and `.dev.vars.example` default to `*`.
   Ordinary control-plane scenarios do not require `WORKTREE_CREATION_ENABLED_IDS`.
   These are Worker settings read by `auth.ts` from this service's `.dev.vars`,
   not driver environment overrides: prefixing the driver command with either
   flag does not configure the Worker. The unannotated template entries pass
   through matching root `.env.local` values during `pnpm dev:env`. Configure
   the Worker before starting it, or restart it after changing these values.
2. Ensure local Postgres is up and root `.env.local` defines `POSTGRES_URL`
   (or export `DATABASE_URL`) — the driver inserts a test user row via
   `@kilocode/db`.
3. Start the stack. The `cloud-agent` group already includes `fake-llm`:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev:start cloud-agent
   ```

   Selecting `kilo/fake-deterministic` is enough to hit fake-llm through
   Next.js. A real-model session (`kilo-auto/efficient`, etc.) uses the same
   Worker URL and does not need a restart.

## Credential containment

Control-plane sessions (`workspace_*`) respect `CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED`.
Only the literal `false` disables containment; local dev defaults to `false`.
The choice is persisted when a worktree is created and inherited by sibling chats.
Changing the environment does not switch an existing worktree or running sandbox
between contained and direct credentials.

When enabled, Cloudflare uses contained sandbox classes and the existing credential
broker; Vercel uses native network policies. Each worktree has stable credential
aliases shared by its registered Kilo roots, while different worktrees have
separate Kilo authentication contexts. Containment failures never fall back to
raw credentials. When disabled, authorized Kilo and repository credentials are
provided directly to the sandbox without alias redemption or credential injection.
Control-plane ownership, attachment scope, terminal authorization, and billing
checks still apply; direct API credentials retain their underlying access scope.
Expired direct-credential terminal leases require a session reattachment rather
than renewing only the server-side grant.

Cloudflare's native outbound handler intercepts ports 80 and 443. With containment
enabled, local targets such as `http://host.docker.internal:<offset-port>` can
bypass interception and reject aliases with HTTP 401. Contained E2E runs therefore
need sandbox-facing endpoints that traverse the native handler, plus the running
`cloudflare-git-token-service` and its capability-encryption configuration. The
local-dev direct-credential mode supports the generated high-port HTTP endpoints.

For new legacy sessions (`agent_*`), `CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED` controls
GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Kilo credential containment together. Containment
is enabled unless this variable is set to `false`. Local `dev` defaults to
`false`; set `CREDENTIAL_CONTAINMENT_ENABLED=true` in `.dev.vars` when using
proxy-compatible upstreams. Legacy devcontainer sessions remain excluded because
DIND does not support managed SCM containment.

Legacy containment flags are persisted at session creation, so changing the
variable affects new legacy sessions, not existing ones.

## Running

> **Non-zero port offset:** except for `multichat-real.ts`, the drivers below use
> the default ports (`8794`/`8811`), which only match a zero-offset session. For any other
> session, first read the offset from `pnpm dev:status --json`
> (`portOffset` field), then prefix every driver invocation with
> `WORKER_URL=http://localhost:<8794 + portOffset>` and
> `FAKE_LLM_URL=http://localhost:<8811 + portOffset>`. Without these the
> driver silently hits the wrong Worker/fake-LLM and every scenario fails
> at connection. See the env-var table below for the full list.

Real-model multichat acceptance (`kilo-auto/efficient`):

```bash
pnpm exec tsx services/cloud-agent-next/test/e2e/multichat-real.ts \
  --auth /path/to/private-auth.json \
  --out dev/logs/multichat-new-run \
  --rounds 3
```

This driver discovers the existing local stack's ports and requires an already
funded test user enrolled for control-plane and worktree creation. Pass credentials
only through an owned mode-600 auth file, never as a command-line token. The output
directory must not already exist. Bootstrap is API-assisted; sibling creation,
sends, and Stop use the real web endpoints. Three chats exercise repeated shared
file writes/reads, native tool overlap, Stop isolation, and post-Stop follow-ups.
Private reports and transcripts are retained; chats and sandboxes are not deleted
automatically. See the known CLI 7.4.20 limitation under Troubleshooting.

Official SDK basic-chat acceptance (pinned `@kilocode/sdk/v2` `7.6.2`):

```bash
pnpm --filter cloud-agent-next exec tsx test/e2e/sdk-basic-chat.ts
```

This uses a funded ephemeral local user and sends only `Authorization: Bearer ...`
to `/kilo`; prompt mutations therefore pass through real public balance
validation rather than the legacy lifecycle driver's tRPC bypass header. Because
`client.session.create()` is deliberately unsupported by the basic facade, the
driver first materializes one owned root through the existing lifecycle setup,
then proves SDK attach/chat behavior: warm and cold projected reads, cold event
wake-up plus `promptAsync()`, intentional `prompt()` rejection, active `abort()`,
stable warm/cold message pagination, and selector rejection without transcript mutation.
It stops owned sandbox families and releases any fake-LLM gate in cleanup.

Focused lifecycle scenario:

```bash
tsx services/cloud-agent-next/test/e2e/run.ts [--api=unified|legacy] [--timeout-ms=<n>] <lifecycle> <conversation>
```

`--timeout-ms=<n>` sets one finite, positive overall deadline for the selected
`long-session`, `cold-resume`, `multi-session-collab`, or continuity scenario
(`recover-same-session`, `interrupt-then-continue`, `warm-cold-cycles`,
`question-idle-resume`, `large-stream`, `concurrent-chats`); it is not a
per-operation timeout. The flag is rejected for all other scenarios.

Long-running scenarios (`long-session`, `cold-resume`,
`multi-session-collab`, and the continuity scenarios `recover-same-session`,
`interrupt-then-continue`, `warm-cold-cycles`, `question-idle-resume`,
`large-stream`, `concurrent-chats`) are not included in `smoke.ts`'s
`DEFAULT_MATRIX`. They take 6–25 minutes and require the funded seeded user
(`E2E_USER_EMAIL=evgeny@kilocode.ai`), the offset-prefixed `WORKER_URL` and
`FAKE_LLM_URL`, and `E2E_MODEL=kilo/fake-deterministic`; the new scenarios reject
other models. They use the unified API and require control-plane/worktree
enrollment.

Matrix (runs the default regression suite):

```bash
tsx services/cloud-agent-next/test/e2e/smoke.ts
```

The matrix starts with `cold-hot`, which pays one cold sandbox boot and then
runs several hot same-session turns. The matrix tracks the session IDs returned by its own start/prepare calls.
After each scenario, including failures, it interrupts those sessions before
stopping sandboxes with proven exclusive ownership. It does not kill unrelated
or previous-run sandboxes at startup. Cleanup failures stop the matrix instead
of allowing pending work to contaminate later scenarios. Kill scenarios inject
their intentional fault before interruption, then cancel remaining work during
cleanup.

Tracking requires a returned session ID. If unified `start` allocates ownership
but fails before returning that ID, the driver cannot automatically cancel it.
Use the failed run's user ID and ownership logs to identify and interrupt only
those sessions; do not infer ownership from container creation time.

Per-run overrides via env vars. Defaults assume a zero-offset session;
for any other offset, compute the real ports from `pnpm dev:status --json`
(worker = `8794 + portOffset`, fake-LLM = `8811 + portOffset`):

| Var | Default |
|---|---|
| `WORKER_URL` | `http://localhost:8794` |
| `FAKE_LLM_URL` | `http://localhost:8811` (host-side view) |
| `E2E_GIT_URL` | `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git` |
| `E2E_GITHUB_REPO` | unset. When set (`owner/repo`), start uses GitHub-app clone instead of `gitUrl`. Pair with `E2E_USER_EMAIL` for the seeded installation. |
| `E2E_USER_EMAIL` | unset (ephemeral `usr_e2e_*`). Set to the cloud-worktree-setup email to reuse that user and its GitHub integration. |
| `E2E_BRANCH` | unset. Optional checkout ref (`upstreamBranch` / `repository.branch`). |
| `E2E_MODEL` | `kilo/fake-deterministic` (the only model the fake serves) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional direct database URL override for this harness |
| `POSTGRES_URL` | Repo database fallback loaded from root `.env.local` / `.env` |

If `DATABASE_URL` is unset, the standalone TSX driver loads root `.env.local`
and `.env`, then falls back to `@kilocode/db` `computeDatabaseUrl()`, which
uses `POSTGRES_URL` for local development.

`FAKE_LLM_URL` is how the **driver** reaches the fake server (for
`/test/release`, `/test/gate-status`, `/test/waiters`, and `/test/requests`
side channels). `KILO_OPENROUTER_BASE` stays on Next.js; the gateway routes
`fake-deterministic` to fake-llm. If you changed the fake's port (e.g.
non-zero `portOffset`), set `FAKE_LLM_URL` to the matching host-reachable
view. Next.js picks up the same offset from `apps/web/.env.development.local`.

## Gateway contract

The fake gateway serves the Kilo routes used in this harness:

- `GET /api/openrouter/models` - runtime model discovery inside sandboxed kilo.
- `POST /api/openrouter/models/validate` - Worker-side fail-fast model validation.
- `POST /api/openrouter/chat/completions` - deterministic streamed completion scenarios.

### SDK coverage boundary

`sdk-basic-chat.ts` intentionally avoids timing-sensitive assertions already
covered by focused unit or Workers-runtime fixtures: multi-root mapping
ordering and zero-DO list projection, R2 replacement races, private-path
optional fixture variants, and SSE heartbeat/comment parsing. The normal acceptance
scenario asserts that blocking `prompt()` remains intentionally unsupported;
chat admission and wake-up are tested exclusively through `promptAsync()`.

## Conversation directives

A conversation directive is embedded in the user-visible prompt as
`__fake__:<scenario>[:<arg1>[:<arg2>...]]`. The fake LLM gateway parses it
from the last user message and dispatches the matching scenario. The
source of directive truth is `test/e2e/fake-llm-server.ts`.

| Directive | Behavior |
|---|---|
| *(no `__fake__:` directive)* | Echo the last user message after stripping kilo `<environment_details>`. |
| `slow:<n>:<ms>` | `n` content chunks `<ms>` apart, then stop + `[DONE]`. Used for pacing/timing probes. |
| `realistic:<text>` | Role delta, 3 deterministic reasoning deltas, then content deltas with whitespace separators as their own deltas, then stop + [DONE] with usage; text is capped at 4000 characters and 512 pieces to emulate a real provider stream. |
| `idle` | One empty-delta chunk, then stop + `[DONE]`. |
| `hang` | Opens the SSE stream but emits nothing and never closes. Drives abort/timeout paths. |
| `error-terminal:<msg>` | HTTP 400 with OpenAI-shaped error body carrying `<msg>`. Exercises nonretryable provider-error propagation through the gateway. |
| `error:<msg>` | HTTP 402 with OpenAI-shaped error body carrying `<msg>`. The non-BYOK gateway converts this to retryable HTTP 503. |
| `gate:<tag>` | Opens the SSE stream, emits no chunks, blocks until the driver calls `POST /test/release?tag=<tag>`. On release, emits `"done"` + stop + `[DONE]`. |
| `read-then-write:<tag>:<srcPath>:<destPath>:<prefix>` | Issues a real `read` for `srcPath`, then writes `prefix` plus a newline plus the cleaned read body to `destPath`, and gates until release. The prefix may contain colons; line-number wrappers and prompt context are removed from the carried body. |

Unknown `__fake__:<name>` directives produce HTTP 402 with
`unknown fake scenario: <name>` — easy to spot in fake-LLM logs.
A prompt with no `__fake__:` prefix echoes instead.

### Side channels

The fake LLM server exposes four helper endpoints for driver code (not used
by kilo):

- `POST /test/release?tag=<tag>` — release a parked `gate:<tag>` turn. 204
  on hit, 404 if no waiter is parked for that tag.
- `GET /test/gate-status?tag=<tag>` — returns `{ tag, engaged }` so the
  driver can poll until a gate is actually holding a stream (i.e. kilo has
  dialed the fake and the turn is blocked).
- `GET /test/waiters` — returns parked gate counts plus live hang/gate streams
  so scenarios can detect leaked fake-server waiters after a terminal turn.
- `GET /test/requests` — returns chat completion request counts so model
  preflight scenarios can prove that rejected models did not reach dispatch.

These are wrapped by `releaseGate()`, `waitForGateEngaged()`,
`fetchFakeWaiters()`, and `fetchFakeRequests()` in `client.ts`.

## Lifecycle scenarios

For the session-continuity contract (long-lived, recoverable chats) and the
reusable catalog of planned and existing scenarios, see
[`SESSION-CONTINUITY.md`](./SESSION-CONTINUITY.md).

| Lifecycle | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cold` | Fresh session; verify a new per-session sandbox appears and the conversation completes. |
| `hot` | Warmup with `echo:warmup`, then send the real prompt on the same session. Same container. |
| `followup` | Same as `hot` today; kept distinct for future resume-path splits. |
| `cold-hot` | One cold turn plus `echo:hot`, `slow:3:50`, and `echo:followup` hot turns on the same session/sandbox. |
| `worktree-shared` | Creates a new worktree and a sibling chat; verifies idempotent creation, a shared dirty checkout, and chat isolation. Requires both `CONTROL_PLANE_IDS` and `WORKTREE_CREATION_ENABLED_IDS` enrollment and `--api=unified`; pass `_` as the conversation placeholder. |
| `long-session` | Runs 11 sequential real file turns (writes plus read/edit turns) in one sandbox, asserting exact dirty file state and this root's checkpoint identity after every turn. Requires the seeded enrolled user and `kilo/fake-deterministic`. |
| `cold-resume` | Waits for the control plane's automatic idle stop, then resumes the same session on a new container and asserts two-sided history preservation and a stable Git HEAD before releasing a gate-only turn; dirty-file survival is recorded as a non-gating observation. Requires the seeded enrolled user and `kilo/fake-deterministic`. |
| `multi-session-collab` | Runs planner, implementer, and reviewer chats serially in one worktree; each real file artifact carries the previous token and all three files are asserted on disk. Requires the seeded enrolled user and `kilo/fake-deterministic`. |
| `recover-same-session` | Captures the target connection by `sandboxId` plus connection/wrapper ids, pauses the owned primary wrapper (`docker pause`), requires a matched recovery-start `allocation_transition` (`allocated.healthy -> allocated.recovering` with `event=deadline`) before any recovery send, then completes a new ordered-lifecycle message on the original `workspace_*` session. A `health_observed` start is reported as generic same-session recovery, not heartbeat coverage. Requires control-plane/worktree enrollment. |
| `interrupt-then-continue` | Interrupts a gated turn, asserts `cloud.message.failed reason=interrupted`, then completes a follow-up on the same session in the same container. |
| `warm-cold-cycles` | Runs two work -> automatic idle-stop -> resume -> work cycles with independent idle-stop evidence, old-primary absence, distinct replacement container, pre-idle history, and a completed ordered-lifecycle follow-up per cycle. Each cycle records its resumed message id and dirty-file survival; completed cycles are retained if a later cycle fails. |
| `question-idle-resume` | Sends a real `question:<tag>:<text>` and leaves it unanswered; requires a positive scoped pending-question observation while the primary is inspectable (inspection failure is inconclusive) and automatic idle-stop within the idle budget, then requires the parked message to be terminal (`failed`/`interrupted`) before continuing. The exact-match target heartbeat `waitingOn=input` is the input-wait proof and may be absent once the parked message is terminal. Continues on a replacement container. |
| `large-stream` | Runs a 256 KiB `tool-stream:<tag>:<bytes>` turn plus a paced `slow:20:50:32` follow-up; claims large-stream coverage only for the exact completed read call whose streamed part is correlated and whose persisted output meets the request, otherwise records requested vs observed vs written bytes. |
| `concurrent-chats` | Boots three independent sessions, parks one gated turn in each with proven overlapping `running`, classifies each `completed_clean`/`completed_after_recovery`/`wedged`/`failed` from matched recovery evidence, and requires a completed same-chat follow-up for any turn that did not complete. |
| `external-kill` | Warmup, `docker kill` the sandbox, send another prompt, verify recovery/failure. |
| `kill-mid-flight` | Cold `hang`, kill while pending, verify DO surfaces disconnect/error. |
| `queue-while-busy` | Block on `gate:<tag>`, enqueue two echoes, release the gate, assert FIFO delivery through `cloud.message.*` events. |
| `queue-rapid-fire-no-gate` | Send immediate follow-ups behind `echo:first` and assert they reach their terminal FIFO state without gate coordination. |
| `queue-overflow` | Block on `gate:overflow`, fill the pending queue until enqueue fails with HTTP 429, release gate, drain. |
| `queue-interrupt-clears` | Block on `gate:<tag>`, enqueue two, `interruptSession`, assert `cloud.message.failed` with `reason: 'interrupted'` for each. |
| `llm-error` | Return fake provider HTTP 402, require the retry status to surface, `interruptSession`, then assert `cloud.message.failed reason=interrupted` and a completed follow-up on the same session and container. |
| `chunked-streaming` | Stream delayed fake chunks and assert multiple downstream `message.part.delta` events survive. |
| `empty-response` | Run `idle`, assert completion, and assert no downstream `message.part.delta` is emitted. |
| `interrupt-mid-stream` | Interrupt an actively gated fake request and assert the active message is interrupted, not a queued message. |
| `unknown-model` | Use a model rejected by the fake validation route and require synchronous rejection before sandbox creation or fake chat dispatch. |
| `waiters-clean` | Complete a normal fake turn, then assert the fake server has no parked waiters or live responses. |
| `callback-completion` | Stand up local HTTP sink, register `callbackTarget.url`, run `echo:done`, assert the sink received `status: 'completed'`. |
| `callback-batch-followup` | Queue two turns behind a gated callback session, assert one callback for the final queued turn, then assert a later hot turn emits a fresh callback. |
| `callback-interrupt` | Local HTTP sink + gated active turn + `interruptSession`, assert callback fires with `status: 'interrupted'`. |

### API dimension

The harness exercises both tRPC surfaces. Pass `--api=legacy` to drive the
`prepareSession` + `initiateFromKilocodeSessionV2` + `sendMessageV2`
procedures (what the web UI uses today); the default `--api=unified` uses
the newer `start` / `send` procedures. `prepareSession` requires
`INTERNAL_API_SECRET` — the driver reads it from `.dev.vars` automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- **Known CLI 7.4.20 stall during snapshot initialization** — Local real-model
  multichat runs have stopped receiving native HTTP responses and global event
  heartbeats after snapshot initialization began, while the Kilo process remained
  alive. Captured container memory was about 1 GB with zero OOM events. The wrapper
  correctly reports `feed_stale` and retires the shared runtime as `kilo_unhealthy`,
  which can fail sibling turns. The underlying native cause is not established;
  snapshot activity is a correlation, not a proven cause. This remains a known
  limitation: keep snapshots and health deadlines unchanged, preserve failed-run
  evidence, and distinguish failed cases from downstream checks that were not run.
- **`Must provide either githubRepo or gitUrl`** — The driver defaults to
  a public HTTPS repo. Override with `E2E_GIT_URL=...` if your network
  blocks GitHub or you prefer a different test repo.
- **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` not set** — Copy `.dev.vars.example` → `.dev.vars`
  and fill in the local secret (same value used by `apps/web`).
- **`POSTGRES_URL not configured`** — Set root `.env.local` `POSTGRES_URL`,
  or export `DATABASE_URL` to override the database URL for this harness.
- **Sandbox calls out to a real provider** — the session model must be
  `kilo/fake-deterministic`, Next.js must have `FAKE_LLM_URL` set (from
  `pnpm dev:env`), and the `fake-llm` service must be running
  (`pnpm dev:status`). Tail the fake's log (`tail -f dev/logs/fake-llm.log`)
  to confirm kilo is hitting it through the gateway.
- **`waitForGateEngaged` timed out** — kilo never reached the fake LLM. Most
  common cause: the session used a real model, `FAKE_LLM_URL` is missing from
  Next.js, or the fake service is not running. Confirm with
  `curl -s $FAKE_LLM_URL/test/requests` (expect a rising `chatCompletions`
  count as kilo dials the fake) and `tail -f dev/logs/fake-llm.log` — a
  stream that stays empty while a turn is "preparing" means the wrapper
  never started, not a fake-LLM problem.
- **`Worker "git-token-service-dev" not found` in `cloud-agent-next.log`** —
  the `GIT_TOKEN_SERVICE` service binding could not resolve. The Worker log
  shows the failure as `Failed to issue Kilo session capability` and the turn
  terminates immediately with `cloud.message.failed`. Cause: the
  `cloudflare-git-token-service` dev process is up on its port but stale and
  not heartbeating into the shared dev-registry (check
  `.wrangler/dev-registry/` for a missing `git-token-service-dev` entry). Fix:
  `pnpm dev:restart cloudflare-git-token-service`, then confirm the entry
  reappears. The fake LLM is irrelevant here — kilo never gets far enough to
  dial it.
- **Matrix fails with `preparing×N` and no terminal** — Correlate the failed
  message with Worker and wrapper logs before classifying the cause. Container
  startup failures happen before wrapper bootstrap; a `post-bootstrap kilo
  session lookup begin` without an end identifies a later native lookup stall.
  Matrix cleanup interrupts its tracked sessions before stopping exclusively
  owned sandboxes. For older runs or an interrupted driver, cancel only the
  recorded run-owned sessions before any owned-family teardown: killing a
  container alone leaves queued work able to recreate it after a Worker restart.
  Preserve the failed result and rerun the scenario in isolation; a successful
  retry does not erase the original failure.
- **`releaseGate` returned 404** — the gate already went away, usually
  because the wrapper's request was aborted (e.g. by an `interruptSession`).
  Queue-interrupt-clears tolerates this; other scenarios treat it as an
  error.
