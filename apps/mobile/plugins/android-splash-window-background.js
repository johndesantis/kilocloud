/**
 * Native backing-surface adapter for the shared branded splash.
 *
 * Android lacks the root-backed storyboard loading view Expo uses on iOS;
 * its window drawable must cover the pre-React gap after the system splash
 * exits. This adapter does not hide the splash: AnimatedSplashOverlay owns
 * that lifecycle on BOTH platforms. The marker/delay below only restores the
 * otherwise-covered Android window background for later rotation.
 *
 * Two platform defaults break the branded launch, and each needs its own edit:
 *
 * 1. `expo-splash-screen` writes `Theme.App.SplashScreen` with the splash-screen
 *    attributes (`windowSplashScreenBackground`, `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`)
 *    but never sets `android:windowBackground`. The theme therefore inherits the
 *    AppCompat DayNight default for the window surface — plain white in day mode —
 *    and any launch frame drawn before the splash window falls back to it: a bare
 *    white screen with no logo, wordmark or progress affordance (the cold-start
 *    finding `app-cold-loading`).
 *
 * 2. `postSplashScreenTheme` points the window at `AppTheme` as soon as the
 *    splash exits, and `AppTheme`'s window background is the app background. On
 *    Android 12+ the system dismisses its splash window about a second after the
 *    activity is created — long before the Metro bundle has loaded and rendered —
 *    so the window surface shows the bare, logo-less app background for the whole
 *    multi-second load. `Theme.App.Launch` keeps the brand drawable as the
 *    post-splash window surface, and `MainActivity` only hands the window back to
 *    the app background once the app's own React content appears.
 *
 * The hand-back is keyed on React's `CONTENT_APPEARED` marker rather than the
 * first draw: the window draws at splash dismissal, seconds before React exists,
 * so a first-draw hand-back would restore the bare surface for the load. The
 * brand surface must not outlive the launch either — the rotation-surface plugin
 * pins `AppTheme`'s window background to the app background so a rotation never
 * paints a foreign frame until React draws again — hence the explicit hand-back
 * the moment the app content is up.
 *
 * Pure data in, data out: the config plugin in
 * `withBrandedSplash.js` owns the mod plumbing, and the unit
 * test drives this module directly.
