/**
 * A translated catalog carries exactly the keys English defines. The launcher
 * copy once moved from `launcher.newAgent` to `glanceable.newAgent`, and the
 * orphan key stayed behind in all 86 catalogs until `check:i18n` reported it.
 * This test pins that class to a fast unit check, so a key removed from
 * `en.json` cannot quietly linger in every other catalog and slip past review.
 *
 * Keys that differ only by a plural category (`_one`, `_few`, ...) collapse to
 * their family: a language needs its own categories, and English is not the
 * reference for those. The family itself must match, exactly as
 * `tools/i18n/check-catalogs.mjs` enforces.

 * Keys `en.json` defines that the translation slice still has to land in every
 * catalog. English copy is written first, and only the translation slice may
 * write another catalog (apps/mobile/AGENTS.md; every other slice's catalog
 * edit is reverted), so copy a slice adds sits in `en.json` alone until that
 * slice runs. Only these keys may be absent; `pnpm check:i18n` still fails
 * every one of them, as does the section's `i18n-missing.py` gate, so the gap
 * cannot ship. Delete an entry the translation slice has landed in every
 * catalog.
 *
 * The notifications.category.*Unavailable reasons below landed in all 86
